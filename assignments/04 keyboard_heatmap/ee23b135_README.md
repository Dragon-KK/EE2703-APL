# Usage
Put all the submitted files `ee23b135_kbda.py`, `ee23b135_layout.py`, `ee23b135_parsing_tools.py`, `ee23b135.py` and `ee23b135.ipynb` in the same directory. Then you may run the program in the following ways

## ee23b135.py
```bash
ee23b135.py {layout_file?}

# Eg: ee23b135.py layout.json
```
You may optionally provided a file path to the json layout (I have submitted a sample of this too) in the cmd line argument

You will be prompted to give a file name later if you don't give it here

The program will give readable errors (I hope) to help lead you in the right path :)

~~Or just like read the code I wrote pleaj~~

## ee23b135.ipynb
Double click on the file to open it lmao.
Then run the cells one by one.
You may provide your custom layout by json or call the function the same way the last cell in the notebook did

(With the characters dict and key dict as stated in the assignment)

### Pls read my code ;-; (I sacrificed EM quiz2 for it)
